<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello audience! My name Dean, I have a baby on the way and im looking for income.
Im currently completing a full stack developer bootcamp so i can hopefully spend as much time as possible studying coding and then find a beginning job to use my new ;learned skills. </p>

  Due in June, We are sooo excited.
